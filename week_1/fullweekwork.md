#  Week 1: RISC-V Toolchain & Debugging

**Goal:** Set up a RISC-V environment, compile and analyze C programs, explore the ABI, debug with GDB, boot bare-metal ELF on QEMU, use inline assembly, perform memory-mapped I/O, implement a custom linker script, understand start-up code, handle interrupts, and compare RV32IMAC vs RV32IMC.

##  Overview
This project is a comprehensive journey through RISC-V bare-metal programming, completed as part of VSD-SoC-Labs Week 1, Sunday, June 08, 2025. It consists of 17 tasks that progressively build skills in RISC-V development, from toolchain setup to advanced low-level programming concepts. The objectives include setting up the RISC-V toolchain, writing and compiling C programs, debugging, and exploring architecture-specific features like atomic instructions and endianness. Key achievements include:

- **Toolchain Setup**: Installed and verified the RISC-V GCC toolchain on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Task 1).
- **Program Compilation**: Compiled a simple "Hello, RISC-V!" C program into an ELF file (Task 2).
- **Assembly and Disassembly**: Converted C to assembly, disassembled ELFs, and analyzed hex dumps (Tasks 3, 4).
- **Debugging and ABI**: Documented the RV32 ABI, debugged programs using GDB and QEMU, and inspected registers (Tasks 5, 6).
- **Bare-Metal Execution**: Ran bare-metal programs on QEMU with OpenSBI, implementing UART output (Task 7).
- **Optimization and Inline Assembly**: Analyzed GCC optimization effects and measured execution time with inline assembly (Tasks 8, 9).
- **I/O and Linking**: Demonstrated memory-mapped I/O, crafted linker scripts, and explained startup code (Tasks 10, 11, 12).
- **Interrupts and Atomics**: Enabled timer interrupts, implemented a mutex with atomic instructions, and compared RV32IMAC vs RV32IMC (Tasks 13, 14, 15).
- **Advanced Features**: Retargeted Newlib printf for UART output and verified RV32’s little-endian nature using a union trick (Tasks 16, 17).

The project targets the RV32IMAC architecture, using QEMU’s virt machine for emulation, and provides a solid foundation for understanding RISC-V bare-metal development.

##  Task 1: Toolchain Installation & Verification



### Objective
Install and verify the RISC-V GNU toolchain to enable compiling and debugging RISC-V programs on a 32-bit RISC-V architecture.

###  Architecture & Platform
- **Architecture**: RISC-V RV32IMC (32-bit base integer, multiply/divide, compressed instructions). This architecture provides a lightweight instruction set for embedded systems, with compressed instructions (C) reducing code size.
- **Platform**: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, a stable Linux distribution, used for hosting the toolchain and running QEMU for emulation.

### Steps
The goal is to set up the RISC-V GNU toolchain, which includes the compiler (`gcc`), debugger (`gdb`), and utilities (`objdump`, `objcopy`).

1. **Download and Extract the Prebuilt Toolchain**:
   ```bash
   wget https://vsd-labs.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/vsd-labs/riscv-toolchain-rv32imac-x86_64-Ubuntu.tar.gz
   tar -xzvf riscv-toolchain-rv32imac-x86_64-Ubuntu.tar.gz
   mv riscv $HOME/riscv
Explanation: Downloads a prebuilt toolchain for RV32IMAC, extracts it, and moves it to $HOME/riscv for easy access.

2. **Update the PATH Environment Variable**:
   ```bash
   echo 'export PATH=$HOME/riscv/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
   source ~/.bashrc
Explanation: Adds the toolchain binaries to the system PATH, ensuring tools like riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc are accessible from the terminal.

3. **Verify the Installation**:
   ```bash
   riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc --version
   riscv32-unknown-elf-gdb --version
   riscv32-unknown-elf-objdump --version

   week_1/task_1/Install and sanity check/1.3.png
   week_1/task_1/Install and sanity check/1.4.png

   
Explanation: Confirms that the gcc compiler, gdb debugger, and objdump disassembler are installed. The prefix riscv32-unknown-elf indicates the target (32-bit RISC-V, ELF format for bare-metal).




  
## Task 2: Compiling a RISC-V C Program



### Objective
Write, compile, and verify a simple "Hello, RISC-V!" C program to test the toolchain.

### Architecture & Platform
- **Architecture**: RISC-V RV32IMC. The base integer instructions (I) handle basic operations, while compressed instructions (C) optimize for smaller code size.
- **Platform**: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, providing the environment for compilation and verification.

### Code

      #include <stdio.h>
      int main() {
       printf("Hello, RISC-V!\n");
      return 0;
      }
Explanation: This program tests the toolchain by printing a message. Since we’re targeting a bare-metal environment, stdio.h functions like printf may not output directly without UART setup (addressed in later tasks). The focus here is on successful compilation.

   ### Compile
    riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc -o hello.elf hello.c
Explanation: Compiles the C code into an ELF file (hello.elf), a common format for RISC-V bare-metal programs.

   ### Verify ELF
    file hello.elf
Explanation: The file command checks the type of the compiled binary, confirming it’s a 32-bit RISC-V ELF executable.



## Task 3: C to Assembly Conversion

**Status:** Completed

### Objective
Convert the C code to RISC-V assembly to understand how the compiler translates high-level code.

###  Architecture & Platform
- **Architecture**: RISC-V RV32IMC. The integer instructions (I) are used for basic operations, and the assembly output reflects this.
- **Platform**: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, used for running the compiler and generating assembly.

### Code
    #include <stdio.h>
    int main() {
    printf("Hello, RISC-V!\n");
    return 0;
    }
Explanation: The same code from Task 2 is used to generate assembly.

### Generate Assembly
    riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc -S -O0 hello.c -o hello.s
    less hello.s
Explanation: The -S flag generates assembly code (.s file). -O0 disables optimizations for readable output.

### Key Assembly Snippet
    addi sp,sp,-16   # Allocate stack space
    sw   ra,12(sp)   # Save return address
Explanation:  
- addi sp,sp,-16: Allocates 16 bytes on the stack for the function’s frame.  
- sw ra,12(sp): Saves the return address (ra) for function return.




## Task 4: Disassembly & Hex Dump



### Objective
Disassemble the ELF and generate binary/hex outputs to inspect the machine code.

### Architecture & Platform
- **Architecture**: RISC-V RV32IMC. The disassembled instructions are from the base integer set (I).
- **Platform**: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, used for running objdump and hexdump.

### Code
    #include <stdio.h>
    int main() {
    printf("Hello, RISC-V!\n");
    return 0;
    }
Explanation: The same code from Task 2 is used for disassembly.

###  Commands
    riscv32-unknown-elf-objcopy -O binary hello.elf hello.bin
    riscv32-unknown-elf-objcopy -O ihex hello.elf hello.hex
    riscv32-unknown-elf-objdump -d hello.elf
    hexdump -C hello.bin
Explanation:  
- objcopy -O binary: Converts ELF to raw binary.  
- objcopy -O ihex: Converts ELF to Intel HEX format.  
- objdump -d: Disassembles the ELF into RISC-V instructions.  
- hexdump -C: Displays the binary in hexadecimal.

###  Disassembly Breakdown
- **Address**: Memory location (e.g., 0x00010100).  
- **Opcode**: Machine code (e.g., 0x01312623).  
- **Mnemonic**: Instruction (e.g., sw).  
- **Operands**: Arguments (e.g., ra,12(sp)).



## Task 5: ABI & Register Cheat-Sheet



### Objective
List all 32 RV32 integer registers with their ABI names and calling-convention roles.

###  Architecture & Platform
- **Architecture**: RISC-V RV32IMC. The ABI defines how registers are used in RV32.
- **Platform**: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, used for referencing the ABI during GDB debugging.

###  Register Table: RV32I Registers & ABI Roles

      .section .text.start
      .global _start
      
      _start:
          la sp, _stack_top
          jal main
          j .
      
      .section .bss
      .align 4
      .space 1024
      _stack_top:
Explanation: Sets up the stack pointer and jumps to main, with a simple infinite loop if main returns.

      riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc -c startup17.s -o startup17.o -marxh=rv32imac -mabi=ilp32
      riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc -c startup17.s -o task17.elf task17.o startup17.o -march=rv32imac -mabi=ilp32 -lc -lgcc
      qemu-system-riscv32 -M virt -bios none -kernel task17.elf -nographic -bios none
Explanation:  
- Compiles the program for RV32IMAC with no standard library.  
- Runs the program on QEMU without OpenSBI.

###  Output
      Bare-metal RISC-V Application Value of x: 43
      Verifying Byte Ordering (Endianness):
      Value stored: 0x01020304
      Bytes in memory (from lowest to highest address):
      Byte 0: 0x04
      Byte 1: 0x03
      Byte 2: 0x02
      Byte 3: 0x01
      
      This system is Little-Endian.
      The least significant byte (0x04) is stored at the lowest memory address.

Explanation: Confirms RV32 is little-endian by default, as the least significant byte (0x04) is at the lowest address.
